## On the importance of soil texture for predicting future global soil respiration
Welcome to the repository dedicated to the `R language` source code for the scientific paper **On the importance of soil texture for predicting future global soil respiration**. This repository provides R scripts and datasets used to analyze and model the influence of soil texture on global soil respiration under future climate change scenarios.

### Objective:
Our objective with this study was to explore the influence of soil texture on future global soil respiration (Rs and Rh) under climate change scenarios up to 2100, considering three Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP126, SSP370, and SSP585). The analysis examines how the inclusion or exclusion of soil texture-related variables affects the predictions of Rs and Rh, allowing for the assessment of their combined effects with climate change over time.
